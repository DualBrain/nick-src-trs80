<p>
This package contains sources which were used to pack and unpack
messages from my BBS system into Fidonet format. There were:
</p>

<ul>
 <li>
  <b>bbass</b> would scan the message base for messages which
  need to be packed up, and do the packing, into Fidonet format
  transfer files for messages. This was only for Echomail, I
  think.
 <li>
  <b>mailass</b> would do the same thing, except for person-to-person
  email.
 <li>
  <b>packdis</b> would disassemble Fidonet format transfer files,
  and I guess it would insert them into the email or the public
  message bases.
</ul>

<p>
This package is mostly here as a test of the issues of packaging up
TRS-80 stuff.

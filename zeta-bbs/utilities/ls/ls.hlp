    Usage:   LS [wildcard]

    LS will display a list of all files on Zeta's disks to its standard output.

    The optional 'wildcard' parameter, if given, is a wildcard using the characters '*' and '?' and ordinary characters where only filenames matching the wildcard will be displayed.

    For example:

ls *              displays all filenames
ls *.C            only filenames ending in .C
ls D*             only filenames commencing in D

Usage: shell

        The Zeta Shell is a command processor. A little like the MS-DOS command.com, a little like Unix's sh. Shell's primary function is to let you type full-line commands which are then executed. The list of commands which can be executed by the shell can be obtained with the CMDS command.

        Shell has some inbuilt commands also.  The most important of these is EXIT, which terminates the Shell and returns to the previously executing program. Shell may execute itself re-entrantly.

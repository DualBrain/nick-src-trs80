RM
--

    RM kills files from disk. Usage is (as in Unix):

          rm [-i] files ...

    The '-i' option is interactive. The name of the file will
be displayed in a prompt, to which you enter the single key
response of either 'y' or 'n' ... 'y' will remove the file
from the directory.

    Currently RM is only usable by the sysop.

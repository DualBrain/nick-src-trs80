   This project encompasses the creation, implementation, testing,
debugging and sometime maintenance of a program
which will encompass the concept of a Tree Structured message
system (a TreeBoard) for the use of the DSP Computing Centre
on their Busicom 186 MP/M-86 system.

   The TreeBoard [The word 'TreeBoard' is (C)opyrighted by
Zeta Microcomputer Software] system will have the following features:


      - Public and Private Mail between system users

      - Flexible Tree system of messages

      - Unique dual-method input system (Single-key or Command-line)

      - Upwards compatible with most RCP/M message systems

      - Upwards compatible with TBBS  menu driven command entry

      - Menu driven with normal/expert menus

      - Can operate as either Tree or List as desired by user


   Source code for the TreeBoard system will remain (C)opyright
Zeta Microcomputer Software but will be licensed to DSP Computing
Centre for their own use only - such as for further enhancements
to the system.

   Object code is for the sole use of DSP Computing Centre.

Process for handling TRS-80 files ...

1. Go through archives in disk sequence
   --> Finished

	1a. Split disk contents into logical groupings

	1b. Convert to unix format.

	1c. Remove all non-source code. asm files which are built from C
	are removed also. Keep documentation and the like

	1d. Find duplicate versions in combined directory, decide on order
	and save in CVS oldest to newest.

2. Rearrange Trs80 CVS tree into a more logical grouping of packages

3. Look for related files from the disks, such as:

	3a. .HLP files from zeta-bbs
	3b. Documentation
	3c. Anything else related to the package

4. Look for object files on disk for which there is no source equivalent

	4a. Disassemble them (using emulator I guess!)
	4b. Add disassembled sources to CVS

5. Go through all the "library" code, figure out latest or greatest
   version, and commit to CVS.

5. Decide on a distribution grouping of directories into packages,
   and write Makefiles to create the packages recursively

6. Write website level documentation (indexes, HTML) for the packages
   and put it all online.

7. Go back through the disks looking for non-source documents which are
   worth preserving, such as:

	7a. Email logs
	7b. Letters, written correspondence
	7c. Financial records

   These things don't need CVS control, but I should have some kind of
   archiving standard. Probably by date.

In July 1984 I was so enamoured of Unix that I thought I should write
a Unix-like OS for the TRS-80. It was beyond my capabilities, but I
didn't find that out until I had written a few hundred lines of
assembler code.

This code doesn't do anything - or maybe it shows a couple of processes
competing for resources.

Unoffset/cmd: Documentation for unoffset/cmd.

'Unoffset' is a program to be used in conjunction with 'OFFSETMx/CMD'
(x=Model No 1 or 3) to provide a 'clean' offset for games and other
programs which would otherwise overwrite Dos when executing.

Unoffset is MOST SPECIFICALLY only to be used for /cmd files created
using Apparat's LMOFFSET program. As those who have used Lmoffset know,
it adds a particularly nasty appendage which requires that the user hit
reset, then type commands under basic to run the program which has been
previously processed using lmoffset. This sort of nonsense is NO LONGER
NECESSARY when an original (ie. tape copy) program is processed using
'OFFSETM1/CMD or OFFSETM3/CMD'.

For those with offsetmx/cmd and programs which have been flawed through
use of lmoffset, this program 'unoffset' will remove only the additions
to the file made by lmoffset, giving the original file back again. In
other words, this is a direct opposite of lmoffset. Once un-offsetted,
the program may then be processed by offsetmx/cmd.

The command format is 'UNOFFSET filename'. Unoffset expects to find a file
called 'filename/cmd' on disk, and writes a file called 'filename/ori'
(for original).

Unoffset prompts for both source and destination disks so the original
and flawed file may be on different disks.

See also the documentation for 'offsetmx/cmd' ie.  'offset/doc'.

>*OFFSETV2/TXT: DESCRIPTION OF THE ACTIONS OF THE PROGRAM OFFSETV2/CMD.

OFFSET (VERSION 2.00) IS A PROGRAM DESIGNED TO CONVERT A /CMD TYPE FILE
FOR EXECUTION FROM DISK. MANY PROGRAMS, ESPECIALLY GAMES, WILL NOT RUN
DIRECTLY FROM DOS BECAUSE THEY OVERWRITE DOS MEMORY WHILE LOADING AND
CONSEQUENTLY CRASH THE SYSTEM. OFFSET IS A PROGRAM DESIGNED TO RELOCATE
ANY CODE WHICH WOULD OTHERWISE OVERWRITE DOS MEMORY (4000H TO 51FFH),
AND RESTORE THAT CODE IN A LEVEL II (NON-DOS, RESERVED MEMORY FIXED)
ENVIRONMENT, THEN EXECUTE THE PROGRAM AS IF IT HAD BEEN LOADED FROM
LEVEL II BASIC VIA THE 'SYSTEM' COMMAND.

COMMAND FORMAT:    OFFSETV2 [%]FILENAME

THE FILENAME SPECIFIED IS THAT OF THE INPUT DISK FILE CALLED 'FILENAME',
WHICH IS TAKEN TO HAVE AN EXTENSION OF '/ORI'. THE OUTPUT FILE HAS THE
SAME NAME, BUT WITH A '/CMD' EXTENSION.

ANY PORTION OF THE INPUT FILE RESIDING BETWEEN 4000H AND 51FFH WILL BE
RELOCATED TO AN UNUSED AREA OF MEMORY, ALONG WITH THE NECESSARY RESERVED
RAM AND SAVED TO DISK. THE OUTPUT FILE (/CMD) WHEN EXECUTED, WILL LOAD AS
NORMAL BUT WITH THE RELOCATED PORTION OF MEMORY. THIS AREA OF MEMORY IS
THEN MOVED TO 4000H. AT THIS STAGE, ALL IMPORTANT ADDRESSES (INCLUDING
RESERVED RAM) WILL LOOK AS THOUGH THEY WERE LOADED THROUGH LEVEL II
BASIC. THE PROGRAM IS THEN EXECUTED THROUGH A SIMPLE JUMP STATEMENT,
WITH INTERRUPTS DISABLED.

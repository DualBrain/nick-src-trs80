<center><h1>TRS-80 FORTRAN</h1></center>

<p>
This package contains some FORTRAN programs I wrote, which compiled using
the Tandy FORTRAN compiler.

<dl>
 <dt>database</dt>
 <dd>This was a simple program to store unstructured text files
 in a tree-structured index. The idea was to provide a kind of
 personal encyclopaedia - a tree of knowledge.</dd>
 <dt>kennel</dt>
 <dd>This is a dog kennel allocation program. When given a list of
 dogs to board, and the arrival and departure dates of each, this
 program attempts to find an optimal arrangement of dogs to kennels
 so dogs never need to be moved from kennel to kennel. It works by
 ordering the arrival dates and assigning in arrival order.
 Unfortunately there is no "incremental update" which is really
 necessary for use in the real world.</dd>
 <dt>library</dt>
 <dd>This is just a collection of a few useful subroutines.</dd>

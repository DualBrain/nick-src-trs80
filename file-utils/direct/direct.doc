               Documentation for DIRECT
               ------------------------

The version released with this document is Version 1.3

    Direct is a program which allows groups of related
files to be easily archived for future use, or transferred
en-masse rather than individually.

    The program itself may or may not be portable, but the
file format used is defined to be identical for all types of
computers, hence "direct format" files are compatible with any
copy of DIRECT, on any given machine.

    In particular, NO file conversions are performed in any
way. Trs-80 and Unix/OS9 both consider files to be character
streams hence exact End-of-files are used. CP/M and related
systems consider files to be chunks of 128 byte sectors and in
such cases DIRECT considers them as character streams however
the true EOF cannot be determined closer than 128 bytes hence
an EOF is stored which is an exact multiple of 128 bytes.

    Direct manipulates two "DIRECT format" files,
one with a suffix of DAT and the other with a suffix of
DIR, in which you can pack any number of regular files,
where each file stored has a machine independant name and
also a short description of the file contents therein.

    For systems which allocate disk space in large chunks,
say 4K at a time or 1.25K at a time, DIRECT saves disk space
because files are packed with minimum space lost.

    For archiving related files, or storing whole packages,
DIRECT is invaluable because you can store many different
directory files on the one disk without getting confused
about which file belongs to which package.

    For file transfer privately or over a BBS then Direct is
also invaluable because you can transfer a whole package at
a time without missing out on any crucial files, and using
Direct to pack files for transfer is also faster than
transferring the files individually.

    You get space for a short description of each file
contained in the twin files, which saves you wondering about
just what it is.


                 The package as supplied...
                 --------------------------

DIRECT is distributed as source code only. At the time of
writing, source exists for the following systems:



- Unix (SysV) and COCO (OS9)      DIRECT.C

     The code is generic but it uses several system calls
     which may not exist on all systems. The calls are to:
     strncpy(), strncmp(), creat(), rewind(),
     fseek(), ftell(), and system().

     The IMPORTANT calls are fseek(), ftell(), rewind().
     You can write the others yourself, and ignore system().


     This version is verified working on Unix Sys-V, and also
     on the Trs-80 Colour Computer running OS-9 and 'C'
     compiler.


- Trs-80 Model I Newdos-80 48K.   DIRECT/ASM

     Requires assembly with Nedas or equivalent assembler.
     May work on other models, or other Doses (except for '!'
     command, "dos command escape").


For all machines:
     Along with the DIRECT source code supplied is this
     documentation file DIRECT/DOC (or DIRECT.DOC)


          Instructions for operating Direct
          ---------------------------------

The version released with this document is Version 1.3
(C/UNIX/OS9 and Trs-80 versions), which support 6 commands
as follows:

          The 'S' (open direct "twin files") command.

     'S': Set which "directory" the program will use.
          Usage is:      S example

                    No suffix allowed on the filename.
                    Uses twin files EXAMPLE.DIR & EXAMPLE.DAT
                        (Trs: EXAMPLE/DIR & EXAMPLE/DAT)

     If the files (example.dir & example.dat) don't already
exist then you will be prompted for a short description of
the intended contents of that 'directory file'

(for example:)

% direct
Direct version 1.3, 09-Aug-86
Direct 1.3 >S mysource
Directory file nonexistant!
Create it? y
Description?  My latest 'C' source code
Direct 1.3 >



          The 'A' (add file) command

     'A': Add a new file to the "directory" file.
          Usage is:      A machinefilename [directfilename]

    Machinefilename is the name of the file on your disks
which you want to store in the twin "direct files".
    Directfilename is optional. It defaults to the same
as Machinefilename. Thats the filename which will be stored
in the twin "direct files".

    Directfilename is a string of 1 to 14 characters. Its
machine independant. Upper and lower case are distinct.
    Machinefilename is a valid filename for your machine.
It is (of course) dependant on your machine.


          The 'X' (Exit to dos) command

     'X': Exit from Direct.
          Usage is:      X
          Any open files are closed.


          The 'E' (extract a file from twin files) command

     'E': Extract a subfile from the "directory" file.
          Usage is:      E directfilename
          You are prompted for the Machinefilename.

          The 'L' (list twin files) command

     'L': List subfiles in the current direct "twin files".


          The '!' (execute a dos command) command

     '!': Perform any valid Newdos-80 dos command.
          Usage is: !commandline
          Supported only on Unix/OS9 and Newdos-80 Direct.

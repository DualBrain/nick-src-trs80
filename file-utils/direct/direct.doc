               Documentation for DIRECT
               ------------------------

    Direct is a machine-independant program which allows
groups of related files to be easily archived for future
use, or transferred en-masse rather than individually.

    Direct lets you setup two "directory format" files,
one with a suffix of DAT and the other with a suffix of
DIR, in which you can pack any number of regular files
where each file stored has a machine independant name and
also a short description of the file contents therein.

    For systems which allocate disk space in large chunks,
say 4K at a time or 1.25K at a time, DIRECT saves disk space
because files are packed with minimum space lost.

    For archiving related programs or whole packages, DIRECT
is invaluable because you can store many different directory
files on the one disk without getting confused as to which
of the constituent files belongs to which package.

    For file transfer privately or over a BBS then Direct is
also invaluable because you can transfer a whole package at
a time without missing out on any crucial files, and its also
faster than transferring the files individually.

    You get space for a short description of each file in a
"directory" file, which saves you wondering about just what
it is.

                 The package as supplied...
                 --------------------------

DIRECT is distributed as source code. At the time of writing,
source exists for the following systems:

   - Unix. (System-V).               DIRECT.C
     Nearly a generic C program except that it needs lseek(),
system(), creat() and a few others. If your 'C' has most of
these then you can run DIRECT.C with a few modifications.



   - Trs-80 Model I Newdos-80 48K.   DIRECT/ASM
     Requires assembly with Nedas or equivalent assembler.
     May work on other models, or other Doses.


     Along with the DIRECT source code supplied is this
documentation file DIRECT/DOC or DIRECT.DOC

     The author of this program runs Zeta Rtrs on
(02) 627-4177 and you may leave a message there if you have
any enquiries.


             How to work Direct
             ------------------

The version currently released with this document is Version
1.0  which supports 6 commands as follows:

     'S': Set which "directory" file the program will use.
          Usage is:      S example

                    No suffix allowed on the filename.
                    Uses twin files EXAMPLE.DIR & EXAMPLE.DAT
                          (or EXAMPLE/DIR & EXAMPLE/DAT)
     If the files don't already exist then you will be
prompted for a description of the intended contents of that
'directory file'.


     'A': Add a new file to the "directory" file.
          Usage is:      A machinefilename [directfilename]

    Directfilename is optional. It defaults to the same
as Machinefilename.

    Directfilename is a string of 1 to 14 characters. Its
machine independant. Machinefilename is a valid filename for
your machine. It is (of course) dependant on your machine.


     'X': Exit from Direct.
          Usage is:      X
                    Any open files are closed.


     'E': Extract a file from the "directory" file.
          Usage is:      E directfilename
                    You are prompted for the Machinefilename.

     'L': List entries in the currently open "directory" file.


     '!': Command escape.
          Usage is: !commandline

        Currently supported only on Unix and Newdos-80 Direct.

    there are 127 Zero bytes at the end of it then you should

Z                      Command reserved for user (appears in a later version of EDAS)
1                      Alter printed lines per page and page length

------------------------------------------------------
Other commands:
<CLEAR>                Clear the CRT screen
<UP-ARROW>             Move up a source line
<DN-ARROW>             Move down a source line

<SHIFT-RT-ARROW>       Page forward one screen (F2 on Model II)
<PAUSE>                Pause any operation (shift-@ for Model I/III, HOLD for Model II)

------------------------------------------------------
Format of the A (Assemble) command:
Usage: A filespec/cmd filespec/ref switches
Switches may be any of:
      -CI  write an object file with no control information
           (core image)
      -IM  assemble straight to memory
      -LP  list onto printer
      -NC  don't print false conditional blocks
      -NE  don't list all bytes made using DEFM etc..
      -NH  no header
      -NL  do not list the source code during assembly
      -NM  do not list expansion of macros
      -NO  no-op
	  -SL  suppress local label listing
      -WE  wait on any errors
      -WO  assemble with object code generation (the default)
      -WS  print a sorted symbol table during assembly
      -XR  write a cross reference file for use by XREF/CMD

-------------------------------------------------------
Format of the WRITE command
Usage: W(switches)filespec
ie.   W+!00$#filename/ext
Switches and their affect:
   +   Write header record on source
   #   Write source including line numbers
   $   write line numbers with bit 7 on
   !xx use XX (hex) as file terminating character.
------------------------------------------------------

Additional Pseudo-Ops available in Nedas:
-----------------------------------------
COM            Put a comment block in the object file

IFNDEF         True if a symbol is not defined
IFREF          True if a symbol has been referenced
PAGE           Do a page throw on a listing pass (assemble)
TITLE          Invokes a heading title for listings
IFEQ           True if the two parameters are equal

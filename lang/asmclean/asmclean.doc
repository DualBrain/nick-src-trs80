Documentation for Asmclean
--------------------------

    Asmclean is a small program which neatens up source files
for Nedas/Edas. It removes the colons from label definitions
and adjusts all comments (which did not start at the start of
the line) to start in a particular column so the comments all
line up. Null lines are replaced by lines containing only a
semicolon for comment.

    Asmclean was compiled with Alcor C, but should compile
clean on any reasonably standard C compiler.

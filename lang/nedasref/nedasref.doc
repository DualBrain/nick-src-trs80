    Documentation for NEDASREF/C    V1.0  02-Aug-86
    ============================    Gustav Francois

   "Nedasref" is a 'C' program which takes an Edas or Nedas
source file (/ASM type) and produces a list of all labels and
where they were defined.

   Nedasref follows the *GET source inclusion chain in the
same way that {N}Edas does. *GET nesting is catered for.

   Nedasref is written in generic 'C' and was compiled using
Alcor 'C'.

   The program may be easily changed to cater for
other assemblers on any machine, such as M-80 or Edtasm+.

   Nedasref attempts to determine the way in which the label
was defined, into broad categories:

CONSTANT   - where the label is followed by EQU or DEFL.
Data....   - where the label is followed by any of:

   BYTE ........ DEFB   or    DB
   WORD ........ DEFW   or    DW
   MESSAGE ..... DEFM   or    DM
   STRING ...... DEFS   or    DS

LABEL      - Any other.
 ??        - When the type cannot be determined.


   Future versions of the program will cater for multiple
defining of labels, values of constants/strings, buffer
lengths and complete label reference report showing all lines
in which the label was referenced and the context in which it
was used (eg: jump to label, pointer, load register).

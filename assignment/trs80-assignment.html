<center><h1>University Assignments</h1></center>

<p>
This package contains the program output from various subjects
I did at University:
</p>

<ul>
 <li>CPX ... Communications Programming (lecturer: John Kaunitz ?)
 <li>OS ... Operating Systems (lecturer: John Colville ?)
 <li>PT ... Programming Techniques (lecturer: John Hughes)
 <li>SIM ... Simulation (lecturer: Tom Osborn, aka Tomasso)
</ul>

<p>
The programs are undocumented so I don't know what they do. They
are all written in Pascal. Multiple incompatible versions of the same
file are given names suffixed with :01, :02 etc in the order they
were discovered.
